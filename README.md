## Installation

Install the latest LTS verion of [Node](https://nodejs.org/).

Open a terminal or command line window in the directory where you have this repository on your local hard drive.

Type `npm install`. This should now install all the software you need to run the game.

## Editing source code

Type `npm start`. This will run the game in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits to the source code, but _not_ if you edit the quest data from the Google spreadsheet.

## Building the game for publishing

Type `npm run build`. This will build the game and put the resulting files in the `build` folder. Put the contents of this folder on a standard web server to deploy the game for others to play.
